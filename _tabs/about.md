Hi! I'm <span style="color:red">**thet0aster**</span>, I am a vulnerability
researcher and a current computer science masters student enrolled through
Georgia Tech's OMSCS program. My interests mainly lie in offensive security
research, binary exploitation, reverse engineering, and malware analysis to
name a few...those sorts of things. But I am deeply passionate about game
dev, emulation, and console hacking as well. My journey in vulnerability 
research began with my interests in ROM hacking and homebrew game
development on devices such as the Nintendo DS and 3DS. 

I want this blog to be a place where I talk about my interests, post
CTF writeups, or document personal projects so that others can learn from
them and contribute. 

Beyond this, I am passionate about music and fitness. I enjoy lifting and I
have played the piano for over a decade
